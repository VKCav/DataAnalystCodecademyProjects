    "So whilst my class and methods work for calculating measures such as average age, no. of children etc, it is not possible to calculate the maximum bor minimum values easily. Unless I store this data in a list, and then run some calculations from that? This however, starts to get more complicated as the list will be by region and include all measures (print(data_list)) to see that the list gets unruly and will have to start indexing the items in the list and creating more methods.\n",
